From the above 5 phases in the final phase ACT phase we will be delivering our insights and providing recommendations based on our analysis.

Here, we revisit our business questions and share with you our high-level business recommendations.

1. What are the trends identified?

Majority of users (81.3%) are using the app to track sedentary activities and not using it for tracking their health habits.

Users prefer to track their activities during weekdays as compared to weekends - perhaps because they spend more time outside on weekdays and stay in on weekends.

2. How could these trends apply to Fitness app customers?

Both companies develop products focused on providing women with their health, habit and fitness data and encouraging them to understand their current habits and make healthy decisions. These common trends surrounding health and fitness can very well abe pplied to App customers.
3. How could these trends help influence Fitness app marketing strategy?

App marketing team can encourage users by educating and equipping them with knowledge about fitness benefits, suggest different types of exercise (ie. simple 10 minutes exercise on weekday and a more intense exercise on weekends) and calories intake and burnt rate information on the fitness app.

On weekends, Bellabeat app can also prompt notification to encourage users to exercise.
